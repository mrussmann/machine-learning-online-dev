# Machine Learning - Online Development Environment

This project provides a one-click development environment for the Stanfort Machine Learning Course on Coursera.
No local setup is nedded, a browser and a Github account is sufficient. You can start working on the excercises in a minute.

With a single click it starts up your personal and preconfigured cloud development environment based on Gitpod (https://gitpod.io/)
with an installed octave environment and a octave plugin if you prefer to use the octave cli version and edit the
files with Theia (https://theia-ide.org/). Gitpod is free to use for under 100 hours of usage a month.

This project doesn't contain any solutions. You should upload your own exercises which are given to you during the course in case they are any changes.
My (untouched) exercises are included for demonstration use.

Just click to start:
